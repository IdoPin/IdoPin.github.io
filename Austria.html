        Austria,[c] officially the Republic of Austria,[d] is a landlocked
        country in the southern part of Central Europe, located on the Eastern
        Alps. The country is composed of nine federated states, one of which is
        Vienna, Austria's capital and largest city. Austria is bordered by
        Germany to the northwest, the Czech Republic to the north, Slovakia to
        the northeast, Hungary to the east, Slovenia and Italy to the south, and
        Switzerland and Liechtenstein to the west. Austria occupies an area of
        83,879 km2 (32,386 sq mi) and has a population of nearly 9 million
        people. While Austrian German is the country's official language,[11]
        many Austrians communicate informally in a variety of Bavarian
        dialects.[12]
