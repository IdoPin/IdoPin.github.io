        Brazil (Portuguese: Brasil, pronounced [bɾaˈziw]), officially the
        Federative Republic of Brazil (Portuguese: audio speaker iconRepública
        Federativa do Brasil),[11] is the largest country in both South America
        and Latin America. At 8.5 million square kilometers (3,300,000 sq
        mi)[12] and with over 211 million people, Brazil is the world's
        fifth-largest country by area and the sixth most populous. Its capital
        is Brasília, and its most populous city is São Paulo. The federation is
        composed of the union of the 26 states and the Federal District. It is
        the largest country to have Portuguese (namely Brazilian Portuguese) as
        an official language and the only one in the Americas;[13][14] it is
        also one of the most multicultural and ethnically diverse nations, due
        to over a century of mass immigration from around the world;[15] as well
        as the most populous Roman Catholic-majority country.
